// what is a package? = is a folder where you can put your (java source files) and (CLASS Files )
// How to create a package?
// In VS Code, create if you create a folder as you usually do and create a java file, that folder is now a package
// as you can see below, package Learn. Here, I just created a folder and named it Learn. Then I created a 
// java file named it LearnClass.java. Inside that file I write java codes. 
// I just simply write package Learn above the entire code to create a package. The package name is as same as
// the folder name. Because, we call it package instead of folder. 

package Learn;

public class LearnClass {


    
}
